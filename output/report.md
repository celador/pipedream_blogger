# Solving AI Agents Issues with Pipedream: A Step-by-Step Guide

Managing AI agents efficiently can be a daunting task, especially when dealing with complex workflows and data integrations. Pipedream.com offers powerful tools that can help solve common issues related to AI agents through automation, data enrichment, and robust testing. In this blog post, we will explore how Pipedream can be leveraged to tackle these challenges effectively.

## Overarching Problem

Imagine you're responsible for managing multiple AI agents that handle various tasks, from lead analysis to customer engagement. Ensuring that these agents perform optimally and are updated with relevant data can be overwhelming. Issues like maintaining robust testing, enriching CRM data, and assessing customer profiles can consume significant time and resources. This is where Pipedream steps in to streamline and automate these processes.

## Solution Overview

Pipedream provides a suite of tools that can address the following key issues:

1. **A.I. Driven Smoke Testing**
2. **Leveraging OpenAI Vision and Puppeteer for Lead Analysis**
3. **Rating Ideal Customer Profile Fit with AI**

Let's dive into each of these solutions step by step.

### 1. A.I. Driven Smoke Testing

Smoke testing applications in production is crucial for preventing regressions and minimizing outages. Pipedream enhances smoke testing through two innovative techniques:

#### Finding Selectors over HTML

Using large language models (LLMs) from OpenAI, Pipedream queries the entire HTML document for specific selectors, reducing the dependency on rigid selectors in UI test code. This ensures that the tests remain robust despite changes in HTML structures.

#### Screenshot Driven Assertions

This technique involves using screenshots of webpages to perform acceptance testing. It ensures that elements are visible and clickable, maintaining the integrity of the user experience.

#### Example Workflow:

```javascript
import { axios } from "@pipedream/platform";
import puppeteer from "puppeteer";

// Step 1: Scrape a website
const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto("https://example.com");
const htmlContent = await page.content();

// Step 2: Pass HTML and prompt to OpenAI
const openaiResponse = await axios({
  method: "POST",
  url: "https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
  },
  data: {
    prompt: `Find all buttons in the following HTML: ${htmlContent}`,
    max_tokens: 100,
  },
});

// Step 3: Perform screenshot driven assertions
const screenshot = await page.screenshot();
await browser.close();

// Use OpenAI response and screenshot to perform assertions
```

### 2. Leveraging OpenAI Vision and Puppeteer for Lead Analysis

Pipedream combines OpenAI Vision and Puppeteer's screenshot capabilities to extract details from incoming leads' websites. This helps in enriching CRM data or notifying teams via Slack/Discord about the lead's details.

#### Example Workflow:

```javascript
import { axios } from "@pipedream/platform";
import puppeteer from "puppeteer";

// Step 1: Trigger from CRM (e.g., HubSpot, Salesforce)
const leadEmail = "lead@example.com";

// Step 2: Extract website from lead email
const domain = leadEmail.split("@")[1];
const website = `https://${domain}`;

// Step 3: Screenshot website and categorize business using OpenAI
const browser = await puppeteer.launch();
const page = await browser.newPage();
await page.goto(website);
const screenshot = await page.screenshot();
await browser.close();

const openaiResponse = await axios({
  method: "POST",
  url: "https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
  },
  data: {
    prompt: `Describe the service or product provided by the following website: ${website}`,
    max_tokens: 100,
  },
});

// Notify teams via Slack/Discord
```

### 3. Rating Ideal Customer Profile Fit with AI

Pipedream can assess the Ideal Customer Profile (ICP) fit by modifying OpenAI's instructions. This allows for evaluating new leads and updating the CRM or notifying teams accordingly.

#### Example Workflow:

```javascript
import { axios } from "@pipedream/platform";

// Step 1: Modify OpenAI instructions for ICP assessment
const icpInstructions = "The ideal customer profile should be a tech company with over 500 employees.";

// Step 2: Evaluate new leads
const leadWebsite = "https://leadwebsite.com";

const openaiResponse = await axios({
  method: "POST",
  url: "https://api.openai.com/v1/engines/davinci-codex/completions",
  headers: {
    Authorization: `Bearer ${process.env.OPENAI_API_KEY}`,
  },
  data: {
    prompt: `Evaluate if the following website fits the ideal customer profile: ${icpInstructions} Website: ${leadWebsite}`,
    max_tokens: 100,
  },
});

// Update CRM or notify teams
```
